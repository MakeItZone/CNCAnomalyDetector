# CNCAnomalyDetector


### 1. Data Collection:
- **Microphone Setup:** Position a high-quality microphone near the CNC mill in such a way that it primarily captures the mill's sound and minimizes external noise.
- **Data Recording:** Record the sound for both normal operations and various anomalies (e.g., dull tools, collisions). Ensure you have a variety of scenarios, speeds, and materials if possible. Label these recordings accordingly.
  
### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- **Segmentation:** Divide the continuous audio data into smaller, fixed-length segments (e.g., 1 second or 0.5 seconds each). This makes the data more manageable.
- **Noise Reduction:** Use audio processing techniques to reduce ambient noise and improve the clarity of the mill's sound.

### 3. Feature Extraction:
- **Fourier Transformation:** Convert each segment of audio data into its frequency domain representation using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
- **Feature Selection:** Instead of using the raw frequency data, extract features that best represent the audio. Examples:
  - Spectral centroid
  - Spectral bandwidth
  - Spectral rolloff
  - Spectral contrast
  - Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
  
### 4. Data Splitting:
- Divide your dataset into:
  - **Training set:** To train the model.
  - **Validation set:** To tune model parameters and prevent overfitting.
  - **Test set:** To evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### 5. Model Selection and Training:
- Choose a machine learning model suited for classification tasks. Potential choices:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Particularly effective for audio data.
  - **Random Forests**
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**
  - **Gradient Boosting Machines**
- Train the model using the training set and validate using the validation set.
  
### 6. Model Evaluation:
- Test your model's performance on the test set.
- Utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix to evaluate its performance.

### 7. Implementation:
- **Real-time Processing:** Stream real-time audio data from the microphone, preprocess it, extract features, and pass it to the trained model for prediction.
- **Warning System:** If the model predicts an anomaly or detects an unwanted sound pattern, trigger a warning or alert. This could be a visual signal, sound alarm, or even a system shutdown, depending on the severity and application needs.

### 8. Infrastructure:
- **Edge Computing:** Consider setting up an edge computing device (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson) near the CNC mill for real-time audio processing and anomaly detection. This reduces latency and the need for constant communication with a central server.
- **Cloud Integration (optional):** If you want centralized logging or remote monitoring, integrate your setup with a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). This allows you to track and analyze data from multiple CNC mills or across multiple locations.
  
### 9. Continuous Monitoring and Updating:
- Continuously monitor the model's performance.
- Periodically retrain the model with new data to ensure its accuracy and relevance.

### 10. Safety and Backup Systems:
- Always have a manual override and backup systems in place. Relying solely on the machine learning model can be risky, especially in safety-critical applications.

Remember, this is a high-level overview, and each step might require in-depth research and fine-tuning. It's essential to work closely with CNC mill operators and experts to ensure the captured data is representative and the implemented system is effective.
